    <p>On Friday and Saturday, November 9-10, a group of volunteers from the Boston Ruby community ran a free
    two-day introductory Ruby and Rails workshop for women and their friends.
    (Women were automatically allowed to apply for a spot, while men were allowed to apply if 
    they knew a woman who was going to attend.)
    Sixty beginners, ?? of them women, attended the workshop at the MIT
    Stata Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A team of 25 experienced Ruby programmers
    assisted them through software installation, lectures and exercises.
    Students who had never written a line of code struggled for the first time
    with the command line, text editors, Git, the HTTP protocol, irb, and Heroku. By 4:30pm on
    Saturday, every student left the workshop with all the tools and concepts needed to write and deploy
    Rails applications.</p>

    <p>We also provided everyone three catered meals, free <a href="http://pragprog.com">PragProg</a> 
    and <a href="http://oreilly.com">Oâ€™Reilly</a> e-books, and free drinks and appetizers at the afterparty.  
    </p>

    <p>This was our second workshop in three months. Please read our <a
    href="/blog/2012_aug_recap">recap of the first workshop</a>
    this past August at Harvard Law School to find out about what inspired us to organize
    RailsBridge Boston workshops.
    </p>

    <p>Based on our exit survey and direct
    feedback, the students found the workshop a well-organized, well-paced, effective, accessible,
    fun, friendly, and inspiring introduction to web application development
    with Ruby and Rails.  
    Here are some of the results we got in our exit survey, which had about a 70% response rate. First, the overall rating distribution:</p>
