On Friday and Saturday, November 9-10, RailsBridge Boston held its
second Ruby on Rails introductory workshop at MIT's Stata Center in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Sixty beginners, ?? of them women, attended
the workshop. Twenty-five experienced Ruby programmers assisted them
through software installation, lectures and exercises.

This was our second workshop in three months. So we don't have to repeat
what we've written before, please read our [recap of the first
workshop](/blog/2012_aug_recap) this past August at Harvard Law School
to find out about what inspired us to organize RailsBridge Boston
workshops and about our basic workshop format.

The students who attended the workshop generally appreciated the
experience. Forty-two out of 60 students completed the exit survey. Over
90 percent gave the workshop a rating of 4 or 5 out of 5.

### TAs, TAs, TAs!

In response to the question, "What did you like most about the
workshop?" people pointed to one thing above all others: the friendly,
knowledgeable, laid-back, nonjudgmental, encouraging teaching
assistants, and the fact that we had enough of them on hand --
approximately 2.4 students per TA this time around -- to answer
questions and help people get past obstacles. (The allusion is to [Steve
Ballmer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE).)

Here is some of the feedback we got on this question:

> The people there were amazing -- all of the organizers and TA's were
> great.  So nice and friendly and helpful.  The attendees were also
> very nice.  Had a good overall vibe/feel to it.

--

> [The TAs] were so encouraging, positive and patient. My group had a
> range of experience levels, with me somewhere in the middle, so I saw
> how well all of the TAs supported those having trouble while also
> challenging those who were breezing through the tutorials...

> The workshop in general was really well run and the
> presenters/presentations were engaging and clear... 

> I loved the empowerment and encouragement that flowed through all the
> coursework, marketing materials, and interactions throughout the day.
> Learning to code isn't easy, and it can be particularly intimidating
> as a female, but I felt extremely comfortable at the workshop and am
> excited to delve into the resources in the Boston Community...

> Awesome job!

--

> The TA:Student ratio (1:2) was amazing!  There was always someone
> to help at any step during the workshop, and all of the TAs were
> incredibly nice, kind, and generous with their help and support.
> Also, the workshop was very well paced. The availability of extra
> credit ensured that students of all levels were engaged and constantly
> learning without putting pressure on the beginner-level students.
> I also appreciated the mix of lectures with workshop segments as
> they provided a great balance for learning. The time frame (1.5
> days) of the workshop was also good for the purpose, though I am
> sure there is interest in a longer workshop. The snacks, meals, and
> social opportunities were also well timed. I am extremely impressed
> by the quality of the workshop and how welcoming all of the TAs
> were.

--

> The ratio of TAs to students was excellent. I was never worried I
> would fall behind the class and get lost. And it was a great idea
> to have all the setup stuff done Friday night. The overall atmosphere
> was very inviting.

--

> The large number of TA's were absolutely necessary since I had many
> questions along the way but was always able to find someone close
> by to provide support.

--

> The TA's and laid back approach really made things fun. By the time we
> got into the work it was easier to raise my hand early, because it was
> established from very early on that everyone who assisted actually
> wanted to work with attendees.  

--

> The TA's were fabulous and there were enough of them that I never
> felt like I had to wait to get a question answered.  I also liked
> the fact that the materials were super well organized and easy to
> follow at your own pace.

--

>  I liked the complete lack of judgement that the TA's exhibited when
>  I asked a million and one questions.  That was nice, it made it
>  easier to ask questions I thought were stupid but needed to know
>  the answer to anyway.

### What to improve in the future

We also asked students if there was anything to improve in the future.

Some students suffered from brain-fry and information overload.  "My
brain was so full by the end of the day, I've had to go back and
re-visit a few things."


We also thank our incredible sponsors for supporting our mission and
making this workshop possible:

We provided everyone three catered meals, free

Common in Kendal Square.

We would also like to thank Andrew Farrell Lauren McLean for helping us
get such a great venue and arrange excellent food service for the
