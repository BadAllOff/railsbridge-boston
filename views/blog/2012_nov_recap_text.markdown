On Friday and Saturday, November 9-10, RailsBridge Boston held its
second Ruby on Rails introductory workshop at MIT's Stata Center in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Sixty beginners, ?? of them women, attended
the workshop. Twenty-five experienced Ruby programmers assisted them
through software installation, lectures and exercises.

This was our second workshop in three months. Read our [recap of the
first workshop](/blog/2012_aug_recap) this past August at Harvard Law
School to find out about what inspired us to organize RailsBridge Boston
workshops.

The students who attended the workshop generally appreciated the
experience. Forty-two out of 60 students completed the exit survey. Over
90 percent gave the workshop a rating of 4 or 5 out of 5.
