On Friday and Saturday, November 9-10, RailsBridge Boston held its
second Ruby on Rails introductory workshop at MIT's Stata Center in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Sixty beginners, ?? of them women, attended
the workshop. Twenty-five experienced Ruby programmers assisted them
through software installation, lectures and exercises.

We provided everyone three catered meals, free
[PragProg](http://pragprog.com) and [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com)
e-books, and free drinks and appetizers at the afterparty at Cambridge
Common in Kendal Square.

This was our second workshop in three months. Please read our 
[recap of the first workshop](/blog/2012_aug_recap)
this past August at Harvard Law School to find out about what inspired us to organize
RailsBridge Boston workshops.

Based on our exit survey and direct
feedback, the students found the workshop a well-organized, well-paced, effective, accessible,
fun, friendly, and inspiring introduction to web application development
with Ruby and Rails.  

And here is a sampling of the general feedback:

We also thank our incredible sponsors for supporting our mission and
making this workshop possible:

get such a great venue and arrange excellent food service for the
workshop.
