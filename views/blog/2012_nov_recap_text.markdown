On Friday and Saturday, November 9-10, RailsBridge Boston held its
second Ruby on Rails introductory workshop at MIT's Stata Center in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Sixty beginners, ?? of them women, attended
the workshop. Twenty-five experienced Ruby programmers assisted them
through software installation, lectures and exercises.

This was our second workshop in three months. So we don't have to repeat
what we've written before, please read our [recap of the first
workshop](/blog/2012_aug_recap) this past August at Harvard Law School
to find out about what inspired us to organize RailsBridge Boston
workshops and about our basic workshop format.

The students who attended the workshop generally appreciated the
experience. Forty-two out of 60 students completed the exit survey. Over
90 percent gave the workshop a rating of 4 or 5 out of 5.

We got a lot of positive general comments. A small sample: 

>  You guys rock!  I've tried learning RoR 3 times before, using
>  different methods (husband-as-teacher, self-study, small class)
>  without success.  I left this course with a project in my head and
>  passion in my heart.  Keep up the good work!

--

>  Great work: the timing for tutorials, presentations, and meals
>  provided the perfect mix. I was never bored or felt abandoned. And
>  just as my brain was beginning to check out, we were already consuming
>  celebratory beers.
>
>  Thank you so much! 

--

>  I like the mix of lectures, "assignments", socials, and food. Well
>  done guys

--

>  Thank you very much for such a good workshop. I appreciated your
>  energy and enthusiasm. After drinks were also very nice and a good
>  opportunity to network with very interesting people.

## TAs, TAs, TAs!

In response to the question, "What did you like most about the
workshop?" people pointed to one thing above all others: the friendly,
knowledgeable, laid-back, nonjudgmental, encouraging teaching
assistants, and the fact that we had enough of them on hand --
approximately 2.4 students per TA this time around -- to answer
questions and help people get past obstacles. (The allusion is to [Steve
Ballmer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE).)

Here is some of the feedback we got on this question:

> The people there were amazing -- all of the organizers and TA's were
> great.  So nice and friendly and helpful.  The attendees were also
> very nice.  Had a good overall vibe/feel to it.

--

> [The TAs] were so encouraging, positive and patient. My group had a
> range of experience levels, with me somewhere in the middle, so I saw
> how well all of the TAs supported those having trouble while also
> challenging those who were breezing through the tutorials...

> The workshop in general was really well run and the
> presenters/presentations were engaging and clear... 

> I loved the empowerment and encouragement that flowed through all the
> coursework, marketing materials, and interactions throughout the day.
> Learning to code isn't easy, and it can be particularly intimidating
> as a female, but I felt extremely comfortable at the workshop and am
> excited to delve into the resources in the Boston Community...

> Awesome job!

--

> The TA:Student ratio (1:2) was amazing!  There was always someone
> to help at any step during the workshop, and all of the TAs were
> incredibly nice, kind, and generous with their help and support.
> Also, the workshop was very well paced. The availability of extra
> credit ensured that students of all levels were engaged and constantly
> learning without putting pressure on the beginner-level students.
> I also appreciated the mix of lectures with workshop segments as
> they provided a great balance for learning. The time frame (1.5
> days) of the workshop was also good for the purpose, though I am
> sure there is interest in a longer workshop. The snacks, meals, and
> social opportunities were also well timed. I am extremely impressed
> by the quality of the workshop and how welcoming all of the TAs
> were.

--

> The ratio of TAs to students was excellent. I was never worried I
> would fall behind the class and get lost. And it was a great idea
> to have all the setup stuff done Friday night. The overall atmosphere
> was very inviting.

--

> The large number of TA's were absolutely necessary since I had many
> questions along the way but was always able to find someone close
> by to provide support.

--

> The TA's and laid back approach really made things fun. By the time we
> got into the work it was easier to raise my hand early, because it was
> established from very early on that everyone who assisted actually
> wanted to work with attendees.  

--

> The TA's were fabulous and there were enough of them that I never
> felt like I had to wait to get a question answered.  I also liked
> the fact that the materials were super well organized and easy to
> follow at your own pace.

--

>  I liked the complete lack of judgement that the TA's exhibited when
>  I asked a million and one questions.  That was nice, it made it
>  easier to ask questions I thought were stupid but needed to know
>  the answer to anyway.

## What to improve in the future

We also asked students if there was anything we could improve in the
future. Here are the most common suggestions.

### Reduce information overload

Some students suffered from brain-fry and information overload.  They
suggested more breaks, a longer and more leisurely workshop, better
priming on foundational concepts and skills, or alternatively some
pre-workshop homework that might reduce the amount of new information
they would have to digest during the workshop.

>  More breaks. My brain was so full by the end of the day, I've had
>  to go back and re-visit a few things.

--

>  While I was able to understand most of the terminology and concepts,
>  I know there were others that didn't have much dev experience going
>  in that struggled with understanding a lot of the concepts   I'm
>  wondering if it's possible to do a big picture overview in the
>  beginning -- this is a terminal, this is an editor, this is what
>  you're going to build today, and maybe spend a little bit more time
>  on some of the important concepts like objects, models, etc.

--

>  May be worthwhile to prepare a "pre-read" document to introduce the
>  absolute basics beforehand and set expectations around what they
>  should know coming in.  I would have been more inclined to do some
>  research beforehand and likely would have gotten more out of the
>  1.5 days if I had this baseline level of understanding.

-- 

>  The curriculum is very well written, it explains very well and
>  clear! I like the presentation in between very much. The only
>  difficulty with that is that if you are behind schedule then they
>  make less sense. I would also be happy to do a weekend course,
>  divide the content over 2 days to feel less rushed to get everything
>  done and have a better preparation to go further with Ruby on rails
>  by yourself. I'd like to give MANY compliments about the whole
>  organization. It was beyond my expectations, really great!

### Assume less knowledge in the lectures 

Some beginners were a bit overwhelmed because some of the lectures
or exercises assumed a little too much knowledge on their part. 

> [S]everal of the lectures were in Japanese for those of us who have
> never programmed anything before....  I have no idea why the things
> they were saying are important because I have never used any other
> programming language and am not at the "super user" stage yet.  That
> time would have been better spent introducing us to the basics of the
> tools you need to code, what typical workflows are for making a web
> app, etc.

--

>  The lectures after lunch on saturday started getting a little over
>  my head. It's probably because of my lack of prior programming
>  experience, but I just thought I'd mention it.

--

>  I'm ... not sure how effective all the lectures were--some of them,
>  including the ones introducing databases, were pretty high-level
>  for a course where most of the women in the room had zero programming
>  experience.  I have some previous programming experience, but never
>  made it to databases, so hearing the way Ruby handles databases
>  compared to other languages was not helpful, since I had no frame
>  of reference.

### Offer post-workshop support and guidance

Many students urged us to offer more structured post-workshop support
as they continued their Ruby and Rails self-education.

>  I feel like I managed to get through everything but now I'm never
>  going to touch Ruby again- it would be nice if there were exercises
>  and tips walking us through them, to guide us beyond the class.
>  Maybe an interactive component for us to follow up on using Ruby a
>  week later.

-- 

>  I think you already have an excellent recipe for success. You had
>  a great number of TAs who were all genuinely warm and patient and
>  able to communicate effectively. I think that's key.
>
>  I'd also love to stay in contact with certain people from the
>  workshop both TAs and other students. Perhaps a google groups?
>
>  In the future, it would be excellent to offer more workshops geared
>  towards those that have completed this first workshop.

--

>  I think it would be great if there was a way to set up more formal
>  continued learning after the workshop. TA's could offer some form
>  of office hours or there could be a way for organizing a study
>  group?

--

>  It was great. I just wish I had a better ability to pick up my own
>  projects afterward. It'd be great if we got more of a framework for
>  starting and setting up projects that we could take with us afterward
>  - like on paper or in a short form online.

--

>  I'd love to see a Beginner's II Workshop, and eventually
>  Intermediate level programming.
>
>  One of the things I struggle with is finding the structured time
>  to sit down and continue with programming. Having another follow-up
>  course, especially if it followed soon after the first one, would
>  help people make the time to keep up with their skills.

### Make sure students internalize concepts

One or two students pointed out that it's perhaps easy to just go
through the exercises just copying and pasting material from the
curriculum without developing a deeper understanding.

>  Overall, I think the workshop was a great introduction to Ruby on
>  Rails that was well-paced and well-structured. At some points, I
>  felt that I was copying and pasting without internalizing what I
>  should be learning from the activities -- I wonder if there is a
>  way to foster more interactive learning on the assignments between
>  the lectures?

We've actually started working on this problem since our last workshop. 
[Brendan Kemp](https://github.com/brendankemp) started hiding steps in
[hint sections](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-boston/commit/b383cb23634554731ad3d2980c3a58e96a033d43)
that students have to click to reveal. We plan to cover more of
the curriculum with these.

### Address late walk-ins, uncivil people, and overdomineering males

Some people did not attend the Friday installfest and showed up on
Saturday expecting a TA to help them through the installation while the
rest of the workshop proceeded. Several students and TAs we surveyed
noted that this presented a serious imposition and drag on the workshop.

We also had one unfortunate incident where a student started saying
disparaging things about transgendered people, at the same a table where
one happened to be sitting. We had no civility policy for workshop
attendees to prevent this sort of thing. But next time [we will have
one](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-boston/issues/2).

One student also pointed out that the men at her table monopolized
the TAs attention a bit too much:

>  In addition, I noted that 2 of the 3 men at my table consumed more
>  TA time and resources than all the rest of us put together, and
>  their female hosts seemed vastly uninterested in the proceedings.
>  That just seemed like flat-out theft of freely offered resources.

### Add brie

One person could only suggest that we add brie to our food offerings:

>  We covered a lot of stuff, I wasn't bored, the cookies in the lunch
>  bags were awesome.  I kinda feel like there should have been brie.
>
>  Just kidding! All correct with me.  Thanks for doing this guys!
>
>  But seriously, next time, brie.
