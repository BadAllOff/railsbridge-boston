On Friday and Saturday, November 9-10, RailsBridge Boston held its
second Ruby on Rails introductory workshop at MIT's Stata Center in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Sixty beginners, ?? of them women, attended
the workshop. Twenty-five experienced Ruby programmers assisted them
through software installation, lectures and exercises.

This was our second workshop in three months. Read our [recap of the
first workshop](/blog/2012_aug_recap) this past August at Harvard Law
School to find out about what inspired us to organize RailsBridge Boston
workshops.

The students who attended the workshop generally appreciated the
experience. Forty-two out of 60 students completed the exit survey. Over
90 percent gave the workshop a rating of 4 or 5 out of 5.

In response to the question, "What did you like most about the
workshop?" people said:

> The people there were amazing -- all of the organizers and TA's were
> great.  So nice and friendly and helpful.  The attendees were also
> very nice.  Had a good overall vibe/feel to it.

--

> [The TAs] were so encouraging, positive and patient. My group had a
> range of experience levels, with me somewhere in the middle, so I saw
> how well all of the TAs supported those having trouble while also
> challenging those who were breezing through the tutorials...

> The workshop in general was really well run and the
> presenters/presentations were engaging and clear... 

> I loved the empowerment and encouragement that flowed through all the
> coursework, marketing materials, and interactions throughout the day.
> Learning to code isn't easy, and it can be particularly intimidating
> as a female, but I felt extremely comfortable at the workshop and am
> excited to delve into the resources in the Boston Community...

> Awesome job!

--

> The TA:Student ratio (1:2) was amazing!  There was always someone
> to help at any step during the workshop, and all of the TAs were
> incredibly nice, kind, and generous with their help and support.
> Also, the workshop was very well paced. The availability of extra
> credit ensured that students of all levels were engaged and constantly
> learning without putting pressure on the beginner-level students.
> I also appreciated the mix of lectures with workshop segments as
> they provided a great balance for learning. The time frame (1.5
> days) of the workshop was also good for the purpose, though I am
> sure there is interest in a longer workshop. The snacks, meals, and
> social opportunities were also well timed. I am extremely impressed
> by the quality of the workshop and how welcoming all of the TAs
> were.

--

> The ratio of TAs to students was excellent. I was never worried I
> would fall behind the class and get lost. And it was a great idea
> to have all the setup stuff done Friday night. The overall atmosphere
> was very inviting.

--

> The large number of TA's were absolutely necessary since I had many
> questions along the way but was always able to find someone close
> by to provide support.

--

> The TA's and laid back approach really made things fun. By the time we
> got into the work it was easier to raise my hand early, because it was
> established from very early on that everyone who assisted actually
> wanted to work with attendees.  

--

> The TA's were fabulous and there were enough of them that I never
> felt like I had to wait to get a question answered.  I also liked
> the fact that the materials were super well organized and easy to
> follow at your own pace.

--

>  I liked the complete lack of judgement that the TA's exhibited when
>  I asked a million and one questions.  That was nice, it made it
>  easier to ask questions I thought were stupid but needed to know
>  the answer to anyway.
