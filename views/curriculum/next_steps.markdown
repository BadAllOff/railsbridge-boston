## Next Steps

You are done the workshop. Congratulations! This is only the beginning of a long
and challenging journey. Please keep learning and coming to local programming events. Here are
some resources you can explore next:

### Meetings

 * **[Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org/)**: The local Ruby community gathers at Brightcove (290 Congress St, Boston) on the second Tuesday of every month. Presentations range from beginner to advanced in level but the major draw is by far getting together with fellow developers and having a good time. Very open and welcoming to beginners.
 * **[Project Nights](http://bostonrb.org/)**: BostonRB also facilitates beginner workshops on the first Tuesday of every month at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) (41 Winter Street, Boston). Project Nights are designed to be very accessible to beginners like you! Bring your projects and get help from other beginners and experienced developers alike. Highly recommended.
