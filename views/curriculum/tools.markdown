# Other Tools to Help You Learn Ruby

### irb

We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough
that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You
can learn a lot from it.
You can do stuff like:

```ruby
$ irb
>> "blah".methods
=> [:<=>, :==, :===, :eql?, :hash, :casecmp, :+, :*, :%, :[], :[]=, :insert, :length, :size...]
```

All of these methods are available for any string. You can then use
ri to look up the method documentation. It is a great way to find goodies!
