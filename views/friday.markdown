# Friday Night

## Installfest

Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and run Ruby code. Work through
these sections in order, and ask questions if you get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the sections, find a staff member to go through the checklist with you.


### 1. Set Up Your Programming Environment

Make sure you have first downloaded all the necessary software for your system
in the [pre-workshop steps](/pre_workshop).

[On Windows](/installfest/install/windows)  
[On Mac OS X 10.6 and up](/installfest/install/osx)  
[On Mac OS X 10.5](/installfest/install/osx-10-5)  
[On Linux](/installfest/install/linux)  

If you're using ChromeOS, please ask a TA to help you get set up. TA, please
consult the Nitrous.io instructions added to [this GitHub
repo](https://github.com/tdenkinger/docs/tree/nitrous.io/sites/installfest).


### 3. Install a Text Editor
You should have installed a text editor that is designed for coding. Here are some suggestions for using it more effectively.
