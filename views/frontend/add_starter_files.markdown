#Goals


*Add some starter files to your project


*Do another test git commit and push

#Steps


>[]()#Step 1:


>Just to speed things up, let's grab some starter files from github.

Go to the 
[front end lesson](https://github.com/eanakashima/front-end-lesson) repository on Github and download it as a zip file.

When the file download finishes, find it on your computer and unzip it.

[]()#Step 2:


>The zip file should contain a file called index.html and a directory of resources.

![](img/zip.png)

Drag the file called index.html and resources folder into your 
[your-github-user-name].github.com project folder. Go ahead and replace the blank index.html file you already have in there.

![](/img/info.png)If you're not sure where you created your project folder in the console, the command 
pwd will give you the path to your current directory.

[]()#Step 3:


>Save your work, commit and push to github.

Type this in the terminal:git add .
git commit -m 'Added starter files'
git push -u origin master

You just added all your changed files to the stage, commited those changes, and pushed the changed files up to github.

#Explanation


>##What Are These Files?



Just to save you some time, we've supplied a bare bones HTML document, a CSS stylesheet,


a JavaScript file, and a placeholder image. But you could have typed up these files yourself


with your text editor, if you'd wanted to.


If you are starting a new project in the future, try typing it all out by hand a few times


to get the hang of it, and then try starting with some other people's HTML boilerplate code


that they've shared:


*[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), a blank template with lots of tips for high-performance best practices.


*[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), an HTML / CSS base with a big library of styles to test out.##Why Did We Go to the Github Site?



The step where we downloaded the files from Github and put them in our project didn't


have to involve opening up the browser, downloading a zip file, and dragging and dropping


files â€” it all could have been done from the command line with git.


As you memorize git commands and get comfortable on the command line, you'll find


it's frequently faster to do these tasks from there, but we wanted to take this chance


to introduce you to the Github web interface. It's powerful enough to let you download


whole projects, fork repositories, and even make basic edits to files, right from


the browser.
