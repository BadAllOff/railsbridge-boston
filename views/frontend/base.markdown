###Goal



To get you started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the most essential building blocks


of web experiences, we'll have you create a basic web page about yourself and deploy


it to the web. You'll:


*Write some content and give it some structure with 
**HTML**
,


*Use 
**CSS**
 to adjust the layout and style of that content,


*Manage your code and push it to a remote server with 
**git**
, and


*Use 
**JavaScript**
 to add interactive components.Here's a sample sketch of what your page could look like:

###Meta-Goal



Many introductions to programming start on the command line and stay


there for a long time before you see any results besides strings of text.


We want to give you tools to make a visual, shareable product

right away, and then start programming on top of that, adding


interactivity to enhance your content.


###Schedule



*1-ish hour of playing with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript


*4-ish hours of building our page and pushing it to githubThis is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go


over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the


day. :D


###Requirements



We're going to be working with:


*[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
(If you're experienced with the developer tools in another browser, that may work too.)


*Git


*A 
[GitHub](http://github.com) account of your own


*The code editor of your choice.

[Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) is a good open source option, if you don't have one yet.

###Working Effectively and Efficiently



I highly recommend you do the following:


*Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.


*Bring up one window with two tabs


*One for this content


*One for interacting with your app.


*Open your text editor and 
do not ever close it. We're not quitters.


*Hide all extra applications. Turn off twitter, IM, and all other distractions.By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the


amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as


you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web


browser gets confusing and wastes time.


###Format



Each lesson will look like this:


#Step Title

  
#Goal:

    
Description of the current step.

Red because big goals are scary.
  
#Steps:

    
steps to take.
    
def code_to_write
  1 + 1
end
    
Yellow because we've gotten it done, but we have no clue what's going on.
  
#Explanation

    
Details of what the steps actually did... spell out the cause and effect.

Green because we can tie everything together now.
