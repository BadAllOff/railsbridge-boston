      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      
      <p>
        Do you dream of someday writing software applications that help people
        and improve the world? 
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Boston Ruby
        Workshop</strong> is a <strong>free</strong> 1.5 day course that will help you 
        start learning how to create that software with <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Led by an all-volunteer team of seasoned and enthusiastic Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers,
        the workshop is designed to provide a solid introduction to concepts,
        tools, and techniques of Ruby and Rails development, as well as an
        entry point into the amazingly active and supportive Boston Ruby
        community.
      </p>

      <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
      <p>
        The workshop is for people who do not have much or any experience programming with Ruby or Rails. 
        But it will help if you are generally proficient with computers and know at least vaguely what a database and a web server are.
      </p>
      <p>
        One purpose of this workshop is to promote diversity in the Boston
        software scene. So the workshop is for women and their guests. To
        attend, you should either be a woman, identify as
        a woman, or be the male guest of a woman who is going to attend.
      </p>

      <p> We will also provide free childcare for any attendee who needs it,
      using a professional childcare service. Please let us know if you want to
      use these services on the application form.  </p>
