# Friday Night

## Installfest

Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and run Ruby code. Work through
these sections in order, and ask questions if you get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

**Note**: If you are using an older version of OS X or a version of
Linux that does not support the virtual machine, please skip steps 1 and
2 and instead use the instructions for your OS:

* [Mac OS X non-VM Setup](/installfest/osx_novm)
* [Linux non-VM Setup](/installfest/linux_novm)

When you are done with all the steps, find a staff member to go through the checklist with you.

### 1. Set Up Your Programming Environment

Make sure you have first downloaded all the necessary software for your system
on the [Downloads page](/downloads). Then:

 1. **Open and run the installer for VirtualBox**

    On Macs, double-click the .dmg ("disk image") file to open it, then
    double-click the installer file. After the installer completes, eject
    the disk image.

    On Windows, double-click the .exe or .msi file. If you are prompted
    with a security warning, click "Run" to allow the installer to run.

    On Linux, depending on your distribution, this may mean installing a
    package file. Ask a TA if you have any questions.

 2. **Open and run the installer for Vagrant**

    On Macs, double-click the .dmg ("disk image") file to open it, then
    double-click the installer file. After the installer completes, eject
    the disk image.

    On Windows, double-click the .exe or .msi file. If you are prompted
    with a security warning, click "Run" to allow the installer to run.
    You may need to reboot.

    On Linux, you will need to install a package file. Ask a TA if you
    have any questions.

 3. **Open and run the installer for Sublime Text**

    On Macs, double-click the .dmg ("disk image") file to open it, then
    drag the Sublime Text app to your Applications folder. Then eject
    the disk image.

    On Windows, double-click the .exe or .msi file. If you are prompted
    with a security warning, click "Run" to allow the installer to run.

    On Linux, you will need to unpack the .tar.bz2 file and follow the
    instructions inside. Ask a TA if you have any questions.

#### Extra Steps for Windows

4. Open the GitHub for Windows installer that you downloaded. If
   prompted during installation, install the Microsoft .NET framework.
   If GitHub for Windows automatically launches after installation, quit
   the application.

5. Launch the Git Shell. You can find a shortcut on your Desktop (grey
   circle with a cat), or locate **Git Shell** in All Programs under
   GitHub. A new (mostly black) window will open.

### 2. Set up your Virtual Machine

Follow the instructions in the [VM Setup page](/installfest/vm_setup).

### 3. Try your Text Editor

You've installed a text editor that is designed for coding. Here are some
suggestions for using it more effectively: [Text Editor](/installfest/text_editor)

### 4. Create a Heroku Account

Heroku is the service that you will deploy your application to.
[Create a Heroku Account](/installfest/create_a_heroku_account).

### 5. Setup Checklist

Find a staff member and run through the
[Installfest Completion Checklist](/installfest/checklist).

### You're Done!

Congratulations, you're done with the Friday tutorial. We'll see you at 9:30am
tomorrow. Please bring the same laptop you used tonight.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on tonight's material,
don't hesitate to let a staff member know. We also have a feedback form
that you can use early and often to provide feedback about the workshop.
