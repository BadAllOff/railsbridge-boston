# Installfest Completion Checklist

1. Create a new ruby file (with an .rb extension). In that file, type:

    ``` ruby
    puts 'Hello World!'
    ```
    Then save the file. From the command prompt, navigate to and execute the Ruby script you just created.

2. Confirm that Ruby and Rails are installed on your machine.  From the command line type:

    ```text
    rails --version
    ```
    
    You should see:
    
    ```text
    Rails 3.2.14
    ```
   ```
    
3. Confirm that your Heroku account is set with your key. From the
   command line, type:

    ```text
    heroku keys
    ```
    And you should see something like:

    ```text
    === youremail@example.com Keys
    ssh-dss AAAAAAAA..12312asfdsdf== user@system.local
    ```

4. Confirm that `git` is set up properly. From the command line, type:

    ```text
    git --version
    ```

    And you should see output like this (the version number doesn't need to be exact):

    ```text
    git version 1.7.10.2 (Apple Git-33)
    ```

5. Get a setup confirmation sticker from a staff member and stick it on
   your laptop where it will be visible when you come back tomorrow morning.

Congratulations! You are ready to learn how to program with Ruby!
