# Installing on Mac OS X

If you didn't install [installed VirtualBox and Vagrant](/pre_workshop) before the workshop, do it now. 

Then [set up your virtual machine](/installfest/vm_setup). That's it!

If you're on this page but actually have OS X 10.5 or earlier, go to the [OS X 10.5 instructions](/installfest/install/osx-10-5).
