# Installing on Mac OS X

## Check your version of OS X

10.6 - 10.8: Go ahead, your instructions are below
10.5: [Go here for your installation instructions](/installfest/install/osx-10-5)

## Install RailsInstaller

### 1. Download RailsInstaller

Go to the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org" target="_blank">RailsInstaller</a> 
page and click "Download the Kit"—the OS X version will 
automatically be downloaded for you. Don't worry about watching the video; we have all the directions you need here.

### 2. Start the Installation

Once the installer is downloaded, find the file and double-click it. This will untar the installer.
Then double click the installer. This will open an installation wizard. 

(If you are told that the installer "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer," 
then you need to go to "System Preferences > Security & Privacy". 
Under the General tab, click the "Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere" button (if that is greyed-out, click the lock in the bottom left). 
Then double-click the installer again.)

* Select your language, then click "OK"
* Click "Next >"
* Enter your Full Name and Email. Use the same name and email for this, GitHub and Heroku. 
* Click "Next" and "Next" and let the installer run.
* Click "Finish" and you are done!

Congratulations, you now have the Ruby development environment up and running. Now go forth and do something awesome with it!
