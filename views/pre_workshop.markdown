# Pre-workshop downloads

Please download the pre-requisite software onto your laptop computer before you attend the workshop. This helps speed things up on Friday and helps prevent the Wi-Fi network from getting clogged.

## OS X

We recommend that you install a "virtual machine" containing all the software you need for the workshop. A virtual machine, or VM, keeps the needed software separate from the rest of your computer and can easily be removed if you only want to use it temporarily.

1. Download [VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88780-OSX.dmg) for Mac. Run the installer after it downloads.

2. Download [Vagrant](http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/db8e7a9c79b23264da129f55cf8569167fc22415/Vagrant-1.3.3.dmg) for Mac. Run the installer after it downloads.

Then, follow the instructions in [VM Setup](/vm_setup).

#### Alternative Method

If your Mac has an operating system older than 10.6, or VirtualBox does not work for you, you can install Ruby and various tools directly into your computer. The easiest way to do this is with RailsInstaller.

1. Download Railsinstaller from the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org" target="_blank">RailsInstaller</a> webpage.
   Don't worry about watching the video. Just leave the download in your Downloads folder.

If you you have an older Mac and cannot run RailsInstaller, get Xcode and ask for help at the installfest.

1. Go to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/downloads), and click Register. Fill out the first page with your account information. The second page is a developer survey, which you can skip. Just go to the bottom and click "Continue".

2. Once you have confirmed your developer account, you can download [Xcode 3.1.4](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.1.4_developer_tools/xcode314_2809_developerdvd.dmg). If that link doesn't work, go to the [downloads page](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and search for "Xcode 3.1.4"

## Windows

All Windows users should use a virtual machine.

1. Download [VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88781-Win.exe) for Windows. Run the installer after it downloads. You can quit the application if it launches at the end of the installation.

2. Download [Vagrant](http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/db8e7a9c79b23264da129f55cf8569167fc22415/Vagrant_1.3.3.msi) for Windows. Run the installer after it downloads. Agree to restart the computer if you're prompted to do so.

3. Download [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) and run the installer. If prompted during installation, install the Microsoft .NET framework. If GitHub for Windows automatically launches after installation, quit the application.

Then, follow the instructions in [VM Setup](/vm_setup).

## Linux

Make sure that Ruby is installed with your Linux distribution's package manager, and come to the installfest.
