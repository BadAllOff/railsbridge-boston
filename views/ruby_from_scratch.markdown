# Friday Setup: Ruby from Scratch (Work in Progress)


__Note to attendees__: This is material that we expect you to read during
the workshop, not before it.  So please wait until then to study this
material.


Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and run Ruby code. Work thourgh
these sections in order, and ask questions if you get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the sections, find a staff member to go through the checklist with you.


### 1. Set Up Ruby
Instructions for installing and running Ruby.

[Install Ruby on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/install/windows)  
[Install Ruby on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/install/osx)  
[Install Ruby on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/install/linux)  


### 2. Using the Command Prompt
The command prompt is the primary way to run Ruby files. In this section you will learn to navigate your filesystem
from your command prompt.

[Command Prompt on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/command_prompt/osx)  
[Command Prompt on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/command_prompt/linux)  

### 3. Starting and Exiting Interactive Ruby
To start writing Ruby code, you will use the Interactive Ruby Shell (irb). It is "interactive" because every time you 
write a line of code and press 'Enter', the code executes and shows you the result. This will allow you to experiment
and get instant feedback.

### 4. Install a Text Editor
You will want a text editor that designed for coding. These instructions will show you how to install a good text 
editor, and the basics of using it effectively.

### 5. Run Ruby from a File
In this section you will learn to run Ruby code from a file, a prerequisite of writing more complex and powerful
programs.

### Checklist of 'Ruby from Scratch' Completion
Find a staff member and run through this checklist:

1. Create a new ruby file (with an .rb extension). In that file, type:

    ``` ruby
    puts 'Hello World!'
    ```
    Then save the file. From the command prompt, navigate to and execute the Ruby script you just created.

2. Confirm that Ruby and Rails are installed on your machine.
   From the command line type:

   ```text
     rails -v
   ```

   And you should see:

   ```text
   Rails 3.2.8
   ```

### You're Done!
Congratulations, you're done with the Friday tutorial. We'll see you at 9am tomorrow at Harvard Law school. Please bring
the same laptop you used tonight.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on tonight's material, don't hesitate to let a staff member know. We 
also have a feedback form that you can use early and often to provide feedback about the workshop.
