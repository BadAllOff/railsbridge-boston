# Friday Setup: Ruby from Scratch
Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and run Ruby code. Work thourgh
these sections in order, and ask questions if you get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the sections, find a staff member to go through the checklist with you.


### 1. Set Up Ruby

Instructions for installing and running Ruby.

[Install Ruby on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/install/windows)  
[Install Ruby on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/install/osx)  
[Install Ruby on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/install/linux)  


### 2. Starting and Exiting Interactive Ruby

To start writing Ruby code, you will use the Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB). It is "interactive" because every time you 
write a line of code and press 'Enter', the code executes and shows you the result. This will allow you to experiment
and get instant feedback.

[Interactive Ruby (IRB) on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/interactive_ruby/osx)  
[Interactive Ruby (IRB) on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/interactive_ruby/linux)  


### 3. Using the Command Prompt

The command prompt is the primary way to run Ruby files. In this section you will learn to navigate your filesystem
from your command prompt.

[Command Prompt on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/command_prompt/windows)  
[Command Prompt on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/command_prompt/osx)  
[Command Prompt on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/command_prompt/linux)  


### 4. Install a Text Editor

You will want a text editor that designed for coding. These instructions will show you how to install a good text 
editor, and the basics of using it effectively.

[Text Editor on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/text_editor/windows)  
[Text Editor on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/text_editor/osx)  
[Text Editor on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/text_editor/linux)  

### 5. Run Ruby from a File

In this section you will learn to run Ruby code from a file, a prerequisite of writing more complex and powerful
programs.

[Run Ruby from a File on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/run_ruby_from_a_file_on_windows)  
[Run Ruby from a File on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/run_ruby_from_a_file_on_mac_os_x)  
[Run Ruby from a File on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/run_ruby_from_a_file_on_linux)  


### 6. Install Dependencies for Saturday Projects

You will need a few other things for the projects on Saturday. We'll install them now to get that out of the way.

[Install Dependencies on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/install_dependencies_on_windows)  
[Install Dependencies on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/install_dependencies_on_mac_os_x)  
[Install Dependencies on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/install_dependencies_on_linux)  


### 7. Ruby Tutorial

Follow this self-directed tutorial to start learning basic Ruby concepts. Topics covered include: how to do math with Ruby, variables,
data types, and flow control. Things are starting to get exciting.

[Ruby Tutorial on Windows](/ruby_from_scratch/first_ruby_tutorial_on_windows)  
[Ruby Tutorial on Mac OS X](/ruby_from_scratch/first_ruby_tutorial_on_mac_os_x)  
[Ruby Tutorial on Linux](/ruby_from_scratch/first_ruby_tutorial_on_linux)  


### Checklist of 'Ruby from Scratch' Completion

Find a staff member and run through this checklist:

1. Start a command prompt, and from that command prompt, start the Interactive Ruby Shell (irb). Then quit irb.
2. Create a new ruby file (with an .rb extension). In that file, type:

    ``` ruby
    puts 'Hello World!'
    ```
    Then save the file. From the command prompt, navigate to and execute the Ruby script you just created.

3. Run the Twitter script you created. Navigate to the Twitter directory and run twitter.rb

    ``` text
    ruby twitter.rb
    ```

4. TODO: Test that the other dependencies are installed.

### You're Done!

Congratulations, you're done with the Friday tutorial. We'll see you at 9am tomorrow at Harvard Law school (TODO: Actual saturday time and location). Please bring
the same laptop you used tonight.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on tonight's material, don't hesitate to let a staff member know. We 
also have a feedback form that you can use early and often to provide feedback about the workshop. 
(TODO: Link to feedback form)
