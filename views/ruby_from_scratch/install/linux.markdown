# Install Ruby on Linux

If you run into errors at any step this step please call in an instructor to help diagnose the installation issue.

1. Install Git and wget

    For Ubuntu:

    ```text
    sudo apt-get install -y git wget zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev

    ```

    For Fedora:

    ```text
    sudo yum install -y git wget zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev

    ```

2. Check out rbenv into `~/.rbenv`.

    ```text
    cd
    git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
    ```

3. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `rbenv`
   command-line utility.

    ```text
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

4. Add rbenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion.

    ```text
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

5. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now begin using rbenv.

    ```text
    exec $SHELL
    ```

6. Install ruby-build.

    ```text
    mkdir -p ~/.rbenv/plugins
    cd ~/.rbenv/plugins
    git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

7. Install the latest Ruby. This may take a while.

    ```text
    rbenv install 1.9.3-p194
    ```

8. Rebuild the shim binaries. You should do this any time you install
   a new Ruby binary (for example, when installing a new Ruby version,
   or when installing a gem that provides a binary).

    ```text
    rbenv rehash
    ```

9. Set the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells.

    ```text
    rbenv global 1.9.3-p194
    rbenv shell 1.9.3-p194
    ```


10. Close an re-open your terminal and confirm Ruby is installed properly

    ```text
    ruby -v
    ```

    You should get something similar to `ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20
    revision 35410) [i616-linux]` If you see something different please
    call in an instructor to help diagnose the installation issue.

11. Install Rails and other supporting gems

    ```text
    gem install bundler rails heroku
    ```

Congratulations, you now have the Ruby development environment up and
running. Now go forth and do something awesome with it!
