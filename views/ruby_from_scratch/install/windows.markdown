# Install Ruby on Windows

Great news, installing Ruby on Windows is easy!

Try [Rails Installer for Windows](http://railsinstaller.org) to get a
Ruby development environment up and running on Windows.

Note: there are some gems and third party libraries that might not play well with Windows. 
While you should be able to develop basic rails applications, gems that require native extensions 
might not properly compile on a Windows machine. 

When this happens, we recommend that [follow these EngineYard instructions](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/virtualize-this-instant-rails-in-a-virtual-box/)
for installing a headless VM using VirtualBox and Vagrant.
