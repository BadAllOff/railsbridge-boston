# Interactive Ruby (IRB)

1. Start up a new command prompt.

2. Type `irb` in the command prompt. You should see something like this:

    ```text
    irb(main):001:0> 
    ```

    You are now at the IRB prompt.

3. Try out a line of ruby. Type:

    ```ruby
    puts 'Hello world!'
    ```

    You should see something like this:

    ```ruby
    irb(main):001:0> puts 'Hello world!'
    Hello world!
    => nil
    ```

4. Exit IRB by typing
    
    ```ruby
    exit
    ```

    and hitting enter. You are now back at the command prompt.

### Success
You can now run Ruby code in the IRB prompt. Practice these steps until you feel comfortable starting a command prompt, 
then starting and exiting IRB.
