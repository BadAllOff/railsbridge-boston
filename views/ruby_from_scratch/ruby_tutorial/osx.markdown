# Ruby Tutorial

Type each of the following expressions at the Ruby IRB prompt (Go back to the Interactive Ruby instructions if you need 
a reminder on how to use the IRB prompt). *No copying and pasting!* You'll learn the concepts better 
if you type them out yourself. After you type an expression, hit `Return`. This causes the Ruby interpreter to 
evaluate the expression.
